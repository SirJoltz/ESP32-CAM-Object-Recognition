The libraries included in the ESP32_Edge_Impulse.Ino script have some small changes made.

In order to run the script
The Libraries inluced here need to be copied to the arduino IDE libraries folder. 
The default folder is - C:\Users\"username"\Documents\Arduino\Libraries for windows

These libraries include: 
	- an edited TFT_eSPI folder that uses the ST7735 driver.
	- the edge impulse project export library for lego blocks
	- standard JPEGDecoder
